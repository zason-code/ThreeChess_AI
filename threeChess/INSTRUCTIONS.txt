Instructions for running code.

I used the text editor BlueJ so you can just go to src and then click on the package.bluej to open the file. 

Then to run the tournament right-click on the ThreeChess class and click on void main. 

To adjust the number of games played, simply edit the ThreeChess.java. In the void main, edit the 3rd argument of the last call of the method tournament.
If you want 50 games to be played, just change the 3rd argument to 50. 


If using a normal text editor like Vscode.

To compile the files, in the root directory use 

javac -d bin src/threeChess/\*.java src src/threeChess/agents/\*.java

To run a basic game, use 

java -cp bin/ threeChess.ThreeChess
